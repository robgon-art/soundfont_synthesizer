Download fluidsynth-2.4.2-win10-x64.zip, unzip the folder, put it someplace on your system and add an environment path to the bin folder.

2. Download or clone the repo to run the code, unzip it, and put it somewhere on your drive.

3. Download a sound font file, like this one, Dore Mark's NY S&S Model B-v5.2.sf2
